# Waydroid-complete-uninstall-temporal-files-script
A script to remove temporal files of waydroid and uninstall it. For some reason, waydroid doesn't remove temp files, and make a complete reinstall isn't possible.

# The script it is made only for fedora 42
this can work in other distros, but be careful.
im not an developer, im only a new student.
